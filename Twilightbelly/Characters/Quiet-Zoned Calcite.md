# *Heads of the Glyphite Archives*
Rare two headed giant from the [[Throthiz Tribe]].
Quiet is silent most of the time while zoned is very passionate about his crafts, even for a [[Throthiz Tribe]] standards. They would like to share their latest creations with someone who can defeat them in duel.
## Stat block
They have two places in a initiative order. They can also swap each other places in the initiative once per battle. Quiet works a little bit like Inventor, with experimental [[Glyphite]] mechanism that needs to be activated to give the giant a boost similar to [Overdrive](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=901). Rest of his actions he uses to quick craft [[Glyphite]] gadgets and use them. He can't move their body during his turn. Zoned works like a monk or a bard. He moves swiftly towards enemy and uses skills to demoralize enemies. He can't manipulate any items or access inventory.
