# Backstory
Ulgrim was born into a nomadic tribe that called the [[Ticklebelly Hills]] home. 

During the [[Twilight Hour]] he was one of the [[Ticklebelly Hill Dwarfs]] suffering from [[Vorgansharax]] attack on the hills. He desperately tired to escape the destruction through the [[Bellybreak Passage]]. He almost died, was saved only thanks to [[Mournwillow]] that blessed him giving him his now signature pink hair. 

Later [[Jotun Stone Giants]] found him at the edge of [[Bellybreak Passage]] and brought him to the [[Wayfarer's Rest]]. There [[Ashen Marble]] took interest in him (maybe they were influenced by their patron?). Ashen took him in as an apprentice and trained him in manipulation of primal magic. 

Over the years he learnt to navigate himself around the giant sized settlement. Using magical vines to reach high places and moving through shortcuts not planned to be used as a passage.

When [[Eon Trials]] were supposed to start Ulgrim wanted to proof himself to be worthy of recognition among giants, even with his small posture. When his request was declined, heartbroken he fled the [[Grimstone Dominion]] to the south. This is where he started his work as an adventurer guarding caravans from monsters that eventually led him to the [[Star Map]]
## Familiar
[[Child of the Willow]] is an energetic partner for stoic and irresponsible Ulgrim. Despite being young small leshy, they are much more familiarized in how society works than their druid partner.
