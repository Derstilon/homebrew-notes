## Current Location
They have their merchant stand placed in [[Wayfarer's Rest]]. They plan on visiting some of the places destroyed by [[Vorgansharax]] to admire his power. They very interested in dragons so it's highly likely to find them anywhere where something important related to dragons is happening.
They sell all items the general store would sell, plus one dragon related special item, [Dragon Gift](https://2e.aonprd.com/Relics.aspx?Aspect=13) at high price or as a quest reward.
## Stat-block
They are standard kobold enemies with alchemist vibe to increase their cooperation. They have high dragon knowledge but might argue between each other regarding certain details. When asked the question, one of them will be right and the other one a little bit misleading.
