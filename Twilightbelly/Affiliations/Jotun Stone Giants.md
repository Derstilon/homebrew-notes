# History
Their civilization existed for milenia. Most of the records of the early years of their tribes are recorded somewhere in their archives lost between countless [[Glyphite]] Knowledge Capsules.
During the [[Twilight Hour]], giants were one of many races that suffered the consequences. The ecosystems of [[Mossveil Marshlands]] and [[Dustswept Plateau]] were disrupted by invasive species fleeing dragon's influence. This resulted in appearance of [[Giant Dragonfly Lair]] in swamp and shortage of fresh water on the [[Emerald Trail]]. By far the biggest tragedy was destruction of the [[Riftloom Citadel]] that occurred due to arcane anomalies during [[Vorgansharax]] attack on the [[Glyphpeak Gorge]] settlements. Since then the Citadel is engulfed by never-ending [[Arcane Storm]] and going there is highly dangerous.
