# History
Their civilization existed for milenia. Most of the records of the early years of their tribes are recorded somewhere in their archives lost between countless [[Glyphite]] Knowledge Capsules.
During the [[Twilight Hour]], giants were one of many races that suffered the consequences. The ecosystems of [[Mossveil Marshlands]] and [[Dustswept Plateau]] were disrupted by invasive species fleeing dragon's influence. This resulted in appearance of [[Giant Dragonfly Lair]] in swamp and shortage of fresh water on the [[Emerald Trail]]. By far the biggest tragedy was destruction of the [[Riftloom Citadel]] that occurred due to arcane anomalies during [[Vorgansharax]] attack on the [[Glyphpeak Gorge]] settlements. Since then the Citadel is engulfed by never-ending [[Arcane Storm]] and going there is highly dangerous.
# Architecture
Each biome has their own distinct style but some aspects are constant throughout the hole [[Grimstone Dominiom]]
## [[Throthiz Tribe]] Architecture
They carve out huge settlements in [[Glyphpeak Gorge]].
Main reference for style would be Ethiopia and their Temples on the cliff sides.
## [[Veltoch Tribe]] Architecture
They lay down landmarks along the trail through [[Dustswept Plateau]]. Most settlements are temporary camps placed around the monuments. Main reference would be Stonehenge or Easter island statues
## [[Bogofthar Tribe]] Architecture
[[Mossveil Marshlands]] are deep and wild in most of the places. Few settlements that exist are typical fishing village build on pier network with some building being much higher above the rest supported on the huge boulders. The capital city [[Tulka Bogstille]] is much more grand and impressive. It looks like Venice but build with rough cut solid rock foundation and hard wooden facades. Fastest means of transportation are rafts regularly going through the city and to other settlements. There are paved paths to use for carts, but this method is much slower due to windy the road is and it's more dangerous as well, since [[Twilight Hour]] when natural ecosystem was thrown off balance.
# Culture
## Tribal lifestyle
They are split into 3 tribes:
1. [[Bogofthar Tribe]]
2. [[Veltoch Tribe]]
3. [[Throthiz Tribe]]
