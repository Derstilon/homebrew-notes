Tribe of cunning trackers and beast tamers. They have great respect for mother nature.
To train their future scouts and beast-tamers they organize egg-hunt-like quests in the wilds.
# Tribe Culture
- Trailsworn recruit elite beast tamers and scouts.
- They help with travel through the [[Dustswept Plateau]] along the [[Emerald Trail]]
- Lately the tribe fights against the ever expanding drought in the [[Springwaters of the Emerald Trail]]
- Veltoch observe migration patterns of all creatures inhabiting mucks, savanna and cliffs all over the [[Grimstone Dominion]]
- Although most of the time, giants from different tribes have vastly different options about basically everything, when they join the trail or expedition, everyone respects Veltoch’s expertise.
- They use special fist bump as a greetings. The way they do this creates sparks from between their knuckles rubbing against each other. Because of that their fists are sharp and more painful when they struck someone.

## Beast Bonding
When trailsworn forms a bond with a creature they perform special bonding ritual. Firstly the giant goes into a wild to find a ceremonial gift for animal. Then they perform ritual in a cave where they attach the gift to animals collar or skin, and then they mark one of their body parts like paws with a paint on the cave wall.

Some giant could need a help from adventures to find perfect tooth or fint for the present, and maybe find special clay to use as a tint.
