# History
Race of lower draconian creatures.
# Culture
## Attitude towards dragons
All kobolds consider themselves to be dragons. This results in 3 different attitudes depending on the tribe:
### 1. Rivalry
Those kobolds use cunning tactics to oppose any [[Dragons]] or tribes of [[Kobolds]] they could find. They have mafia-like relationships in their tribes.
### 2. Pride
Those kobolds start to mimic [[Dragons]]. They hoard their own treasure and look down on every lower being they encounter.
### 3. Worship
Those kobolds consider [[Dragons]] to be perfect beings, a form they should strife for. They worship [[Dragons]] like gods. Whenever there is some activity of [[Dragons]], you can find many kobolds observing them or even actively trying to help. They are immune to dragon's influences, but their culture still revolves around voluntary aid towards the dragons. Kobolds from [[Sequinscale Caravan]] represent mostly this type.
