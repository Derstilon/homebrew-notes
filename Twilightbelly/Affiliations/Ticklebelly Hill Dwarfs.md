# History
They migrated from location to location, living off the land. They would seasonally travel north to the [[Orchard Grove]] and back south to winter camps like [[Gunzar Camp]]. Occasionally they made contact with [[Jotun Stone Giants]] to the west from [[Raptorspine Mountains]] and beyond or [[Humans of Phalan]] from the [[City-state of Phalan]] to the east. They shared stories and resources with those humans and giants. 

They were almost completely wiped out during [[Twilight Hour]]. The cultists from the [[Cult of the Dragon]] came to the hills and began raiding nomad camps for victims to offer to the [[Vorgansharax]]. Eventually, the dragon moved on to attack [[Humans of Phalan]], but life was never again the same for the nomads of the [[Ticklebelly Hills]].
