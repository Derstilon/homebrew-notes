- Stereotypes tell that physical strength is the only thing that can grant you their respect, but in fact they value courage above anything else.
- They love to drink Muck Ale and have a soft spot for wordplay and puns. If you join their community meal you need to tell them the stories of you heroic deeds.
- Their weapons of choice are tridents made of durable ore.
- Their leaders are great tacticians and know how to read and create simple [[Glyphite]] constructions.
- Due to their experience in wet environments they can move in shallow water as easily as on solid ground.
