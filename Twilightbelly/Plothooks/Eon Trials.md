# 3. Trial of Brilliance
Organized by the [[Throthiz Tribe]].
Participants are teleported into a ruins of the [[Riftloom Citadel]] devastated by [[Arcane Storm]]. Everyone has been assigned  to unique [[Glyphite]] knowledge capsule they need to extract from the ruins. Their objective is to survive, find their target and reach eye of the arcane storm. On their way stand arcane polluted monsters, malfunctioning rune golems or dangerous traps and ever approaching arcane storm barrier. Once they grap all the loot, find their targeted and reach the center, they can finally return through the arcane space rifts which will bring them back to where they were teleported from. There is nothing to gain from fight between contestants but helping others can give players favors (could give them reward afterwards or know they way to abandoned exit from the citadel when party loses their chance to exit through rifts).
