Phenomenon active in [[Riftloom Citadel]]. It prevents spellcasting by making it much less potent or even twisting the effects. Any magical constructs or items goes savage when left under the influence of the storm for a long time. Because of that all [[Glyphite]] constructs and mechanisms in the citadel are highly aggressive and dangerous. [[Riftloom Citadel]] used to be accessible with rift teleportation devices, but now those work only for a small time window each week. If you get stranded without rifts active you need to survive a week fighting against citadel machines or gamble with high level magic, it could (for PC will) teleport you out of the citadel.
