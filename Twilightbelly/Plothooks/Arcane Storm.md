Phenomenon active in [[Riftloom Citadel]]. It prevents spellcasting by making it much less potent or even twisting the effects. 
# Description
Any magical constructs or items goes savage when left under the influence of the storm for a long time. Because of that all [[Glyphite]] constructs and mechanisms in the citadel are highly aggressive and dangerous. [[Riftloom Citadel]] used to be accessible with rift teleportation devices, but now those work only for a small time window each week. 

# Plot hooks
### What if you fail to escape?
- If you won't manage to get to the rift teleportation devices on time you will get stranded in the [[Riftloom Citadel]] an need to survive for a week fighting against citadel machines. 
- You can also gamble with high level magic, it could (for PC will) teleport you out of the citadel to some random location.
- You could also be lucky to be stranded with a giant who heard about old exit shaft in the Citadel. If can defeat few arcane infused oozes you will be able to escape the ruins back to the [[Glyphpeak Gorge]].
### What if you want to fix it?
* There has to be source of this storm. You could ask about it before heading into a trial.
* Maybe it's a powerful [[Glyphite]] artifact that was destroyed during [[Twilight Hour]]. If you manage to find it and solve puzzle to deactivate it you could bring peace back to the citadel.
* It could also be a [[Throthiz Tribe]] Giant that was thought to have died during [[Twilight Hour]]. 
  With his many [[Glyphite]] runes inscribed on him, when [[Vorgansharax]] attacked the citadel he overloaded his magical energy and crated the storm. If you kill him or manage to bring him back to his sense you can get rid of the storms for good.
