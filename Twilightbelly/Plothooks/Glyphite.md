Something between Talismans and Magic Scrolls.
[[Jotun Stone Giants]] developed a technique to weave words, magic, and memories into stone items. If you want to read them you need help from Jotun Archivists. If you want to use one you need to [Affix](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=3204) or [Trick](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=5229) it and then treat it as a [Invested](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=3138) item.

They can be sold in main hubs in [[Grimstone Dominion]], found in quest areas like [[Giant Dragonfly Lair]], [[Springwaters of the Emerald Trail]], [[Riftloom Citadel]] or received as a reward like [[Quagmire's Crown]]
