# Description
The moment in recent history recorded by [[Jotun Stone Giants]].
It happened when [[Cult of the Dragon]] attacked the general area of [[Raptorspine Mountains]]. Most people don't know what was a purpose of this attack. The only clear fact is that they were following the will of [[Vorgansharax]] who later settled near the mountains in [[City-state of Phalan]] and lives there to this day. 
# Plot hook
Maybe he just wanted to change location of his lair, and made a huge historic event in a process.
Or maybe his plans are related to the main story, and full extends of his scheme are yet to unfold.
