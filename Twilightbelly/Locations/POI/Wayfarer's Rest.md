Small settlement with an inn at the edge of the [[Mossveil Marshlands]]. This is one of the starting points of the [[Emerald Trail]] and popular place for giants from both [[Bogofthar Tribe]] and [[Veltoch Tribe]] gather and feast. It's also an important trade-point for traders coming from the south and going further to the north either thorough [[Dustswept Plateau]] or [[Mossveil Marshlands]]. It's the place where [[Ulgrim Twilightbelly]] grew up when he was taken in by [[Jotun Stone Giants]]
