# Geography
Lush jungle caves with giant flora and fauna. Has bright huge clearances with crystals shining in the ceiling. Dark caves have many scary predators that adapted to the darkness in a same way as deep ocean fishes did. There are no permanent settlements for [[Jotun Stone Giants]] but they marked few shrines and safe cave branches. It's not that big but difficult terrain makes it seem like it's a huge area.
