## 50 Character Builder Questions
by Ginny Di
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Are you a morning person or more of a night owl?

    - It depends on the current Curse Difficulty Class that changes throughout the story. Naturally, he is a night owl and likes to tinker with his machines or do some research, but when wild instincts kick in, he tries to limit activities at night.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
2. What’s the first thing you notice about someone when you meet them?

    - He notices any signs indicating their social status, genealogical relations, and power dynamics with other people nearby. He's particularly attuned to the unique auras of emotionally scarred individuals.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
3. You see a huge spider in your room. What do you do?

    - He only notices such details if there is nothing else preoccupying him, which would be irrelevant to this specific spider. If he sees the spider, he starts wondering, "When was the last time the room was cleaned?" and "How much did this spider catch?", where the answers to those questions result in this abnormally huge spider.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
4. If you could go back and change one decision you made in the past, what would you change?

    - He is pretty young, so he didn't have much time to make any regrettable decisions. He is pretty frustrated with many dead-end leads on his path to get rid of his beastkin-tainted blood.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
6. Do you give people second chances?

    - If people have a reason to lie, exploit, or betray, they will do that sooner or later. On the rare occasion when an exposed person has no immediate reason to betray you again, it's okay to give them a chance. Otherwise, mercy will only bring you more suffering.

    - As the curse grows in power, his preference switches from dogs to cats.

23. Who do you look up to?

    - As he grew up, every one of his relatives began to look more and more disappointed in his eyes. The only person he has genuine respect for is his craftsmanship master. Their passion for crafts and views on the world were something he'd never seen anywhere else.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
24. When you go to a tavern, what do you order?

    - His Beastkin problems intensify when he is drunk, so naturally over time, he stopped drinking any alcohol even though the curse difficulty class was at its lowest.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
28. Are you a planner, or more spontaneous?

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
29. Can you keep a secret?

    - Not for free, but if someone is already on good terms with him, keeping this friendly relationship is enough of a reward to protect the secret. Strangers would have to give him some encouragement to keep their secrets.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
30. Do you like being the center of attention?

    - In such a situation, it's really easy to scout out people's characters and attitudes. He shines when he is at the center of attention, but  it's important for him not to overdo it, because many situations require discreetness, so it's better if the attention of everyone doesn't automatically focus on him when he enters the room.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
38. How do you deal with being sick? Are you stoic, or super whiny?

    - Seafood and Wine.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
43. Are you more of a hoarder or a minimalist?

This is how even though he doesn't hoard items, he always has enough raw materials to create anything simple.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
44. Are you superstitious?

    - He assumes all leaders, royals, chieftains, and similar sorts are prideful and fake. Other than that, he is open-minded and can quickly change his attitude when provided with relevant proof.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
