Ritual that was once searched by [[Starcrest Family]]. When successfully performed during an Eclipse the caster and anyone in the range of the ritual is greatly buffed in their own specific expertise. The hunters of the [[Starcrest Family]] wanted to use this ritual to gain the edge against [[Moonbound Beastfolk]] they were hunting for milenia. The head of family also had ulterior motives for this ritual's effects. Currently there is a gossip among the family members that someone in the house has found the trail of this ritual's location.
